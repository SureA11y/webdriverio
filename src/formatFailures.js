/**
 * Turns a11y-core's checksResults array into a short, human-readable block
 * -- one entry per occurrence, not per rule, since a single rule can flag
 * several elements. Meant to be handed to an assertion library's own
 * failure-message parameter, e.g.:
 *
 *   const results = await new A11yCoreBuilder({ page }).reportOnly(['fail']).analyze();
 *   assert.strictEqual(results.checksResults.length, 0, formatFailures(results.checksResults));
 *
 * Deliberately a plain function, not a custom `expect` matcher -- it has no
 * dependency on any particular assertion library (node:assert, Jest, Vitest,
 * or a hand-rolled `if`/`throw` all work the same way), matching this
 * project's own test-runner-agnostic stance elsewhere (see
 * ROADMAP.md's note on §6, examples/e2e runner choice).
 *
 * @param {Array<object>} checksResults a11y-core's checksResults array (or
 *   any subset of it, e.g. already passed through .reportOnly()) -- see
 *   ../a11y-core/docs/OUTPUT_SCHEMA.md for the shape.
 * @param {{ outcomes?: string[] }} [opts] Which outcomes to include.
 *   Defaults to ['fail', 'cantTell'] -- the two outcomes that ever carry
 *   occurrences (see OUTPUT_SCHEMA.md's note on `pass`/`notApplicable`
 *   always having occurrences: []).
 * @returns {string}
